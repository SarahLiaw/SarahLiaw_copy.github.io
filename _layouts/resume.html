  <h1>My Resume</h1>
  <p class="fs-5 col-md-8">My writing is divided into three categories: tutorials, notes, and blog posts. Tutorials are self-contained guides focused on solving problems and building things. Notes are references on things I have learned. Blog posts are more personal writings on a variety of topics that I find interesting.</p>
