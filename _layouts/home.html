  <h1>Just exploring.</h1>
 </p>Hi, I'm Sarah Liaw, a rising Junior at Caltech majoring in Computer Science and Maths. I will document things that happened (or write things I remember about things that have happened).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pursuing Computer Science at Caltech.</li>
    <li>I enjoy solving problems in mathematical settings and applying them in real-world applications.</li>
    <li>SURFing with Dr. Ricardo Baptista (Summer 2023).</li>
    <li>Finish CS159: Advanced Topics in ML (Uncertainty Quantification) and excited to start CS153: Advanced Topics in Theoretical CS (MCMC Algorithms).</li>
  </ul>
