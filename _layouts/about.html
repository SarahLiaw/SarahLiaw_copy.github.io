  <h1>Hi, I'm Sarah.</h1>
  <p class="fs-5 col-md-8">There are three things that I am passionate about: solving problems, building things, and learning. I solve problems during the day through my job as a <a href="https://www.interfaceware.com/company">solutions architect</a>. I build things at night through my <a href="https://github.com/LeNPaul">open source projects</a>. I learn things on the weekend and write about them on <a href="/writing">my site</a>.</p>

  <h1>Hi, I'm Sarah.</h1>
  <p>
    I'm currently a rising Junior at Caltech majoring in Computer Science (and Mathematics?). I like solving problems in mathematical settings and finding real-world applications for my work. I have had the opportunity to work with esteemed professors such as Professor Aadel Chaudhuri, Professor Soon Jo Chung, and currently, I am working under Dr. Ricardo Baptista to further develop research in approximations of nonlinear manifolds, density estimation, probabilistic graphical models, and learning their structure with minimal assumptions on their distribution.</p>
  <p>Outside of work, I have been actively involved in various committees at Caltech, including the Academic and Research Committee and the Board of Control Committee. I am also a member of the dance club, where I participated in the dance show in 2023! Additionally, I enjoy playing badminton and I am a member of the Caltech Data Science Club. Recently, I have also started to learn how to play chess, and am finding it to be a fun and engaging experience.</p>
  <p>In the past, I had the privilege of being a member of Malaysia's Asian-Pacific Informatics Olympiad team. I also led the Untitled Space MY initiative, and I welcome any inquiries about it. More recently, I gained valuable experience working with Dr. Matt Todd at University College London (UCL) in the MycetOS initiative, focusing on the synthesis of novel molecules for neglected diseases like Mycetoma. This experience has significantly shaped my ideas and passion for drug discovery, particularly in the realm of computation and open-source research.</p>
  <p>These diverse experiences have shaped both my perspectives and my goals. Currently, my interests lie in algorithms (specifically in queueing theory and game theory), machine learning, computational drug discovery, and statistical learning. Additionally, I am fascinated by the ways in which we can enhance our learning experiences.</p>
