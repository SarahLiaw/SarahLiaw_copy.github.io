      <h5><a href="/jekyll-tutorials">Quantification of Predictive Uncertainty with Scalable-Uncertainty Aware Models</a></h5>
      <p>In the context of exact GP inferences, DKL models usually suffer from poor scalability in the size N of the dataset due to the O(N<sup>3</sup>) computational complexity of GPs. Additionally, exact GP inferences are only possible for Gaussian likelihoods, making approximation necessary for classification tasks. To address both issues, Ober and Rasmussen introduced the use of stochastic variational inferences for GPs, leading to the development of stochastic variational deep kernel learning (SVDKL).
      As part of the CS159 (Uncertainty Quantification) project, we propose frameworks with SVDKL as an improvement to DKL to quantify uncertainty estimates in medical classification tasks and show the importance of lower dimensional representations in scalability for GPs.</p>
